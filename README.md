## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

With our project we hope to be able to use this dataset to compare different shows or movies using various metrics such as ratings, release date, length, actors, etc. Seeing as how we use Netflix a lot ourselves, weâ€™re interested in this dataset because it would be quite helpful for us when trying to find new shows to watch with all the various metrics available to help narrow our search. A question that we would like to specifically explore involves our own favorite actors, we want to see whose favorite actor has the most movies/shows, higher ratings, etc. and this dataset would make it easy to do so. After taking a quick look at what user-facing data dashboards are, we do believe we could make a fairly functional dashboard for this dataset once we learn the necessary coding for it. We have a lot of information that can be included in the dashboard such as highest rated tv shows/movies of all time or for a specific year, most popular actor/actress etc. This dataset provides us with many faucets of information to explore and use to our advantage.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Based on our dataset, we plan to use numbers and dates for Netflix TV shows and movies up until the year 2019. This dataset will include 10 columns which will display many aspects to what Netflix has to offer such as directors, cast involved in movies/shows, countries in which movies/shows were filmed, ratings etc. The data provied was collected up until year of 2019. The purpose of this dataset aims for public interest considering Netflix is the top streaming platform there is on the market which may appeal to most students and fellow data scientist. The dataset was human collected overtime owned by a grandmaster user on kaggle that goes by the name of Shivam, also updated by verified users that have private access to the database. Our groups goal going forward with this project/dataset is to further our understanding on how the entirety of a dataset works along with the process, manipulation etc. that comes with it.
